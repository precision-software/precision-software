ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m John Morris, a software engineer currently working on the PostgreSQL database.

While I consider myself a "generalist", I enjoy diving deep into select topics.
At various points I've been into 
- automated theorem proving,
- database performance,
- backend development, 
- geographic information systems and 
- a bit of machine learning..

Language-wise, C++ is my native tongue, but I'm a polyglot at heart. (Scala, Java, Python, PHP, Rust ...)

Please feel free to reach out to me. Email works, and if you are in the SF Bay area, I'm always up for meeting over a latte'.
